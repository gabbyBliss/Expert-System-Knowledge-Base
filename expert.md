## Understanding Knowledge Bases and Databases

In the realm of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, a critical distinction lies between knowledge bases and databases. These two entities serve different functions and have unique characteristics.

**Knowledge Base:**

A knowledge base acts as the reservoir for domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise that are leveraged in expert systems and decision-making processes. It encompasses well-organized domain-specific information that supports problem-solving. Within expert systems, the knowledge base consists of rules and facts that govern the decision-making process.

```clips
(defrule allergy
  (symptom runny-nose)
  (symptom itchy-eyes)
  =>
  (assert (diagnosis "Allergic Rhinitis"))
```

**Database:**

Conversely, a database functions as a structured repository for data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval and are a cornerstone in numerous data-driven applications. They typically store raw data and facilitate structured querying and retrieval, often utilizing the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation.

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```
